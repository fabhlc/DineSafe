    "## Introduction \n",
    "<a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this study is to visualize food-establishment turnover in the City of Toronto using DineSafe inspection data. Establishments that handle food are required to undergo **at least one inspection per year**. As such, it's fair to assume that the DineSafe data provides annual snapshots of all food-establishments in Toronto. Premised upon this, this analysis aims to visualize establishment turnover, which may act as a means to indicate the economic health of an area, particularly areas downtown. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the analysis, it was found through conversations with a DineSafe Quality Assurance staff that understaffing issues have resulted in certain low-risk food-establishments (e.g. convenience stores) skipping up to two years of inspections. Acknowledging this and other shortcomings in data methodology, this analysis will focus on surface-level findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This notebook will be split in two key parts: (1) [Methodology](#methodology) and (2) [Analysis](#analysis).\n",

    "<a id=\"methodology\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Data Origin \n",
    "<a id=\"data_origin\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was downloaded from the City of Toronto's [Open Data portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) as of December 12th, 2018. However, this data only dates back two years. To extend our horizon, we accessed  the Web Archive (thanks [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/SherylsCrush/status/1068618721650982914)) and obtained DineSafe data since July 2011<sup>1</sup>. Since half of 2011 was missing, we decided to remove this year and start with a complete set of 2012 data. We acknowledge that the last two weeks or so of 2018 data are missing from our study, but we can also anticipate this will have minimal impact on our exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preliminary Cleaning\n",
    "Because XML is gross, we formatted the raw data into a readable DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "Original data showed the exact inspection date. As we only care about year, we converted that column to show only year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on their 'safety hazard' classification, establishments are inspected between one and three times a year. This would result in duplicates, whereas we only want establishments to appear maximum of once per year (to indicate existence). So as part of the preliminary cleaning process, we removed duplicated instances of **Establishment_IDs** per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geocoding\n",
    "Interestingly, only the December 2018 dataset had Latitude and Longitude attributes. We geocoded the remaining address using a combination of matching with available addresses, matching with [One Address Repository](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#f71a13c4-fb51-6116-57b7-1f51a8190585) addresses, and using Google's Geocoding API.\n",

    "More cleaning/processing needs to be done but below is the initial dataset we have to work with:"

    "We have 99,587 rows of data. Ultimately, we want to transform this data into a DataFrame that shows when establishments existed each year, from which we can visualize 'change' year over year. But first we need to clean out certain datapoints which may add noise from our study. As we can see from the graph below, the majority of food establishments are restaurants and take-out spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caveats\n",
    "- While most addresses are for standalone establishments, it's important to highlight that several are retail plazas. As such, several establishments could exist simultaneously, disallowing us from pursuing the easy route of simply grouping our data by address to show turnover. Doing so would cause one establishment to incorrectly represent a plaza that may actually have 10 establishments. To account for this, we first group by **Establishment_ID** in a dataframe then, from that dataframe, group by address (explained in the following 'Cleaning' section).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We noticed that some establishments would skip a year of inspection - despite the requirement for having a minimum of one inspection per year. Per conversations with DineSafe staff, this was due to staffing issues and a backlog in inspections. This was more likely for low risk establishments like Gateway Newsstands. Standards were higher for high risk level establishments (e.g. those that handled raw meats). \n",
    "\n",
    " To address this, we built a function that would selectively fill in gaps in years (in separate notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/fabhlc/DineSafe_Gentrification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although an address may have the same name through the years, we also notice sometimes the **Establishment_ID** would change. DineSafe staff noted that any change in establishment ID is a result of change in ownership. In certain cases, this could mean the establishment continued operations under new management (owner). We count this as a 'change'. Notably, renovations do not result in a change in **Establishment_ID**. "

    "To keep this notebook concise, you can find detailed steps for data cleaning and transformation (including criteria for keeping certain establishment types) in a separate notebook in my [GitHub](https://github.com/fabhlc/DineSafe).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Cleaning \n",
    "<a id=\"cleaning\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we rid the data of establishment types that may not necessarily aid our analysis. This includes things like Retirement Homes wth catering services, mobile hot dog carts, hospitals, and cruise boats. Food court vendors were also removed from our data as we wanted to concentrate the focus on standalone restaurants. This leaves us at 86,079 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we remove data from large venues and stadiums like *Exhibition Place, Rogers Centre*, and *Downsview Flea Market*. Similarly, these often have different characteristics that impact turnover rates differently compared to 'stand-alone' addresses we're looking at. We are now at 83,520 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor cleanups were needed along the way, such as correcting \"5078 DUNDAS ST E\" to \"5078 DUNDAS ST W\", replacing \"&\" with \"AND\" for consistency, and replacing apostrophes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key DataFrames\n",
    "From our original data, we derive two key dataframes:\n",
    "1. **turnover**: Turnover by Establishment ID\n",
    "2. **turnover_address**: Turnover by address and their associated neighbourhoods. (Neighbourhood association executed by QGIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Feature Engineering \n",
    "<a id=\"feature_engineering\"></a>\n",
    "#### Dataframe 1: turnover \n",
    "This first dataframe was built to show in which years establishments existed. A key feature engineered out of the data and shown as columns in this dataframe is **yearly change**. This binary data indicates whether an establishment continued its existence or non-existence from year to year. For example, if an establishment existed in 2012 but ceased in 2013, this would be indicated by a \"1\" in change_2013. \n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, certain establishments show gaps in existence (as a very real consequence of staffing issues). We built a function to fill in these gaps. Essentially, where there were more than two 'changes' in the six 'change' columns, the function would convert these existence gaps from 0 to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataframe 2: turnover_address\n",
    "From the first dataframe, we grouped the data by address to shift the focus on addresses, creating the second dataframe, **'turnover_address'**. Additional features were engineered out of this to measure change:\n",
    "- ** Total Turnover**: This is the total number of changes at this address (e.g. sum of all closures and openings).\n",
    "- ** Annual Turnover** : Total turnover divided by the number of years (six).\n",
    "- ** Max Units **: Maximum number of units existing at a single address in any given year between 2012 and 2018. (Ideally we would have data on the number of retail units at an address. This assumption would be the next best thing).\n",
    "- ** Change Index **: annual turnover divided by max units (to account for different weights of addresses with multiple establishment units). \n",
    "- ** Multi Units **: Binary for if there is more than one establishment at this address.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change Index\n",
    "Change Index values typically span from 0 to 1, with zero indicating no change throughout the six year period. For example, a Change Index of 0.5 would mean an address has a 50% chance of 'changing' each year, whether by closure or new opening. The city-wide average change index of 0.2114 indicates food-establishment addresses have a 21% chance of turning over each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only 11 addresses (0.09% of addresses) exceed 1.0 and range from 1.33 to 1.67. This is because openings and closings in establishments account for 'one' change each, so if an establishment closes by the end of 2014 and another opens in its place in 2015, **change_2015** would have a value of 2.\n",

    "Scarborough has the highest rate of turnover on average while Etobicoke seems to be the most stable. When we move a level down to the neighbourhood level, we see that less aggregated data at this level shows that individual neighbourhoods in Scarborough have a noticeably higher rate of turnover than the rest of the city. The map below shows how the Change Index of each neighbourhood compares to the city-average. More mellow colours indicate turnover closer to the city average Change Index of 0.2114, while more red pigments indicate neighbourhoods with higher-than-average turnover and conversely for blue pigments.\n",

    "### Scarborough\n",
    "It's difficult to overlook these trends in Scarborough so it's worth mentioning a few points about this ethnically and socioeconomically diverse suburb of Toronto. There are several obstacles to operating a successful food establishment in Scarborough that make it different from more central parts of Toronto:\n",
    "- Scarborough has lower spending power than the rest of Toronto (\\$79,000 average household income in Scarborough vs. \\$103,000 across Toronto as of 2015)<sup>2</sup>. This translates to less disposable income for eating out - a pricing consideration for the area's food-establishments.\n",
    "- Scarborough's population comprises almost two-thirds immigrants and non-permanent residents<sup>2</sup>. Although more recent immigrants have much higher spending power<sup>3</sup>, earlier immigrants are generally more prudent and financially conservative, especially in the time following immigration. These cultural and socioeconomic factors push towards them being less likely to eat out on a regular basis. On the other hand, time passed since their immigration as well as today's more diverse food scene reflecting their homeland's cuisines may be shifting inclinations.\n",
    "- Anecdotally, successful restaurants opened by immigrants from the 90s are shutting down as owners are retiring and their adult children don't want to take over.\n",
    "- Millennials are influenced by social status and the \"instagrammability\" of restaurants they eat out in - which is often downtown.\n",
    "- The suburban built form of Scarborough and street-facing-parking orientation of retail plazas inhibit the visibility of restaurants. This makes it harder for passersby to notice and discover restaurants. While marketers may help a business overcome this with a strong social media presence, the older generation of restaurateurs may struggle to attract a steady stream of new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above socioeconomic, cultural, and built-form factors, and assuming a similar set of differences in the other boroughs of Etobicoke and North York, it is difficult to paint Toronto and Scarborough with the same brush. A deeper dive into Scarborough's food scene may be worth pursuing, but it would be out of scope for this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Side Note:\n",
    "That being said, it should be noted that when we google 'restaurant closure toronto', we get detailed articles mourning the loss of neighbourhood fixtures in more downtown-centric (and predominantly White) neighbourhoods like Leslieville ([one](https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2018/02/lil-baci-italian-restaurant-closing-toronto/) and [two](https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/food/saturday-dinette-closed-toronto/)), [Parkdale](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/we-re-being-squeezed-out-locals-try-to-save-parkdale-restaurant-amid-gentrification-worry-1.4359744), [Little Italy](https://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/grace-restaurant-closed/), and [Chinatown](https://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/why-the-closure-of-a-restaurant-can-feel-like-a-death) (frequenters of Toronto's Chinatown today more closely resemble a United Colors of Benetton ad). However, searches for 'restaurant closure scarborough' yield nothing, despite anecdotes of established local neighbourhood favourites closing. A question worthwhile asking may be \"where are all the obituaries in mainstream media for Scarborough's (and Etobicoke's) established favourites? How will their contributions and service as a gathering place for the local community be documented?\"\n",

    "#### \"Invisible\" Turnover \n",
    "Interestingly, despite a high turnover at **56 Kensington Avenue**, the only establishment that has existed at this location between 2012 and 2018 is Kensington Variety. Throughout this six-year period, Kensington Variety has kept its name, but possessed three different establishment IDs - i.e. changed at least three times. As previously mentioned, this may be attributable to change in ownership. While a deeper dive is required to verify this, it brings to our awareness the effects of \"invisible\" turnover - where a business storefront remains the same but the original owner(s) has been bought out. To anyone interested, it may be worthwhile perusing a licensing database to see where establishments are being pushed out 'invisibly'.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Note: Data Weakness\n",
    "This example admittedly shines a light on a shortcoming in our data - 56 Kensington Avenue appears vacant in our data during certain years but this isn't true.  Understaffing issues are to blame, which create a wrinkle in the premise of \"minimum once a year\" inspections. On the other hand, only low-risk establishments like convenience stores are affected so the integrity of our study is not jeopardized.\n",

    "1192 Queen Street East, 1808 Eglinton Avenue West, and 3358 Dundas Street West are tied for the highest turnover. We can confirm these turnovers with Google Streetview's historical captures. For 1192 Queen Street East, food establishments typically lasted a year before changing hands and a new restaurant was always quick to open in its place. Below is a collection of streetview images of 1192 Queen Street East:\n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "<a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "From something as simple as food inspection data, we can derive many insights by transforming and reformatting the data. This exploratory analysis has hopefully demonstrated the potential for public data to be used in a way that can spark ideas and confirm hypotheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other analyses that may be worth pursuing using this data and methodology may be:\n",
    "- the impact of transit projects (like the Eglinton LRT) on local neighbourhood businesses; \n",
    "- correlations between local average housing values over the years to restaurant closures; \n",
    "- scraping and joining Yelp data (check if legal) to attribute each restaurant to a price point (or cuisine) and deriving trends from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, I'm happy to chat about best practices, different ideas, or learn from your experiences with this type of data. I can be reached on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/fabiennechan) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiennechan/).\n",
