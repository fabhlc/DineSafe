# DineSafe

## Introduction

The purpose of this study is to visualize food-establishment turnover in the City of Toronto using DineSafe inspection data. Establishments that handle food are required to undergo at least one inspection per year. As such, it's fair to assume that the DineSafe data provides annual snapshots of all food-establishments in Toronto. Premised upon this, this analysis aims to visualize establishment turnover, which may act as a means to indicate the economic health of an area, particularly areas downtown.

During the analysis, it was found through conversations with a DineSafe Quality Assurance staff that understaffing issues have resulted in certain low-risk food-establishments (e.g. convenience stores) skipping up to two years of inspections. Acknowledging this and other shortcomings in data methodology, this analysis will focus on surface-level findings.
